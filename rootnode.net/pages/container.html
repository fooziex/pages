	<p class="lead">Rootnode is trying to merge the best parts of shared hosting and Virtual Private Server (or VPS). We are proud to introduce Linux containers (or LXC), a secure and stable platform to fulfill your deepest desires.</p>

	
	<h4>Every user has a container</h4>
	<p>A "container" is a lightweight virutal system mechanism, sometimes described as <em>chroot on steroids</em>. Containers offer excellent user isolation and easy resource control.</p>
	<p>From the user's perspective, every container operates like a seperate operating system, with its own memory, disk space and network stack. Each container is fully separated from other containers. It is a much more secure solution than shared hosting, but it also introduces a number of limitations.</p>

	<h4>Containers are read-only</h4>
	<p>The operating system in the container runs on a read-only filesystem. Even after gaining root privileges, you will not be able to mess up the system (much). Naturally, user's home directory is writeable.</p>
	<p>This setting makes configuration a little more complicated compared to VPS, because files are shared with a template container. On the other hand, all changes can be made in one central location, which is very convenient.</p>

	<h4>No root privileges</h4>
	<p>The simple reason you can't have root access is because it would be highly insecure. LXC is not intended for such usage and as such it would be prone to many vulnerabilities, which could allow eventual escape from the container and full access to the host system.</p>

	<h4>Shared configuration</h4>
	<p>Many configuration files are shared <em>(symlinked)</em> and stored in a read-only directory <tt>(/etc/shared)</tt>. This directory belongs to the template container and is, from time to time, updated. We do not recommend you replace any of the symlinks linking to this directory with your own versions. It will lead to serious problems in your container, even after small configuration changes made by us to the global container.</p>
	<p>Please <a href="/contact">contact us</a> if you really need configuration change. We will add it globally.</p>
	
	<h4>No public IP address</h4>
	<p>Sad, but true. As the IPv4 pool is exhausted, we are not able to give away a public IP address for every container. 
	
	<h5>Network traffic</h5>
	<p>Network traffic is limited to per-user ports and DNATed to particular container. Default firewall policy is <strong>DROP</strong>.</p>
	<p>Web traffic is handled by reverse proxy on a per-vhost basis.</p>

	<h5>User ports</h5>
	<p>Every user has 10 predefined ports with prefix equals to the user's uid. Port numbers are from <code>$UID<em>0</em></code> to <code>$UID<em>9</em></code>. For user with uid <span class="change">1234</span> it would be from <span class="change">12340</span> to <span class="change">12349</span>.</p>
	
	<p>SSH and FTP services have <strong>reserved</strong> user ports. Port <code>$UID</code> for SSH connection and port <code>$UID0</code> for FTP connection.</p>
	
	<p>User ports summary.
	<table class="table">
		<tr><th>Port</th><th>Port for UID=1234</th><th>Description</th></tr>
		<tr><td><code>$UID</code></td><td>1234</td><td>SSH connection</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>$UID0</code></td><td>12340</td><td>FTP connection</td></tr>
		<tr><td><code>$UID1:$UID9</code></td><td>12341:12349</td><td>Any use</td></tr>
	</table>
	</p>

	<h4>Strict memory limit</h4>
	<p>Each container has a memory limit which can result in undesired behaviour. The default memory limit per container is <strong>128M</strong> or <strong>256M</strong>, depending on user needs. If you need more, do not hesitate to ask for more, giving us a good reason. Otherwise, optimize your container for memory usage.</p>

	<p>When you exceed the  memory limit,the kernel kills a random process. In the worst-case scenario, <tt>sshd</tt> daemon can be killed and you will not be able to log back into the container without admin help. We are working to fix the problem.</p>

	<h4>Other limitations</h4>
	<p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>chsh</code> command does not work. Default shell is <tt>bash</tt>.</li>
		<li>No information about your container's memory usage is shown in <code>htop</code>. It shows the overall memory usage of the server.</li>
	</ul>
