	<p class="lead">Rootnode is a very unusual kind of shell hosting. Actually, we don't even like to call it <em>hosting</em>. We are social-oriented, we have subversive ideas and we are very eager to make this place unique.</p>
	<h3>We are social</h3>
	<p>We love to share knowledge and we like to work together. The most important part of Rootnode is its community. We obliterate the stereotype of lonely user sitting in front of a terminal. There are many other users you can communicate with in the old-fashioned way: using <a href="/contact#lists">mailing lists</a> and an <a href="/contact#irc">IRC channel</a>.
	</p>
	
	<h3>We do open source</h3>
	<img style="float:right" width="100px" src="/vendor/open-source-icon.png"/>
	<p>A lot of people think that open source means for <strong>free</strong>. It doesn't. Rootnode is not "free as in 'free beer'" due to our many expenses. Rootnode has to pay for colocation, server leasing, electricity and bandwidth.</p>
	<p>However, Rootnode is "free as in 'free speech'". Being social hosting, Rootnode makes everything we create available for free in public git repositories which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/rootnode">https://github.com/rootnode</a>.</p>	

	<p>Currently, we use the following <tt>git</tt> repositories:
	<ul>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rootnode/lxc">lxc</a> - linux containers related software, tools and configuration.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rootnode/satan">satan</a> - shell account service manager.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rootnode/scripts">scripts</a> - small scripts and additional tools.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/rootnode/pages">pages</a> - this website and other Rootnode web pages.</li>
	</ul>
	Feel free to make improvements!</p>

			<h1>Our philosophy</h1>
		</div>
	<p class="lead">Rootnode is a hobby project. We do it <strong>for fun</strong>. Never, ever consider Rootnode as a commercial or professional solution. We are untrustworthy, unreliable and you better have a backup :)</p>

	<h4>No clients</h4>
	<p>Although, we take money from you, <strong>you are not a client</strong> and we will never treat you like one. Please, don't behave like one. You are a user and community member. Be nice to us and we will be nice to you.</p>
	
	<h4>No guarantee</h4>
	<p>We do not guarantee anything - no SLA, no uptime, no anything. You will not get your money back when something fails. Consider yourself warned! This is not a joke. If you are demanding by nature, please, do not purchase an account.</p>
	<p>We make mistakes and servers fail. If something does go wrong, you can always check our current status at <a href="http://rootnodestatus.net">http://rootnodestatus.net</a>. We do not hide anything.

	<h4>No official support</h4>
	<p>We are system administrators and, as such, we don't really have much time. Still, we read e-mails and we will probably answer yours but we cannot guarantee a time when it will happen.</p>
	<p>However, there is some good news. We have active <a href="/contact#lists">mailing lists</a> which are a really good place to ask for help. Be kind, describe your problem precisely and remember to at least attach the following details:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>uid</strong> and/or username</li>
		<li><strong>server name</strong>, e.g. <em>web1</em></li>
		<li><strong>executed commands</strong> with full input and output</li>
	</ul> 
	<span class="label label-important">Important</span> Do not hide or obscure any domain names; it will only make the problem harder to solve.</p>

                        <h1>From scratch</h1>
                </div>
        <p class="lead">We take all our experience and start again.</p>
        <img style="float:right" src="/img/growth.jpg"/>
        <p>Rootnode originally started in the year 2006. From then to now, we have given our users a lot of freedom and access to a large number of services. Not only shell hosting but also application hosting, VPN, torrent, SHOUTcast and more.</p>
        <p>Growing up in this uncontrolled way has also led us to multiple vulnerabilities and our systems were compromised eventually.</p>
        <p>We decided to start over -- to rethink and do it from scratch. Needless to say, this process takes a lot of time and tremendous effort. Because of this, <strong>many services are currently unavailable</strong>, and have to be redesigned with security in mind.</p>
        <p>Rootnode was entirely colocated in datacenter in Amsterdam, Netherlands. We have already invested a lot of money in our own hardware. Ultimately, we decided to power off this location and it is currently unavailable, waiting for a huge maintenance process and eventual reopening.Currently, we are building the new Rootnode on dedicated servers colocated in Europe.
        <p>Long story short:
        <ul>
                <li>We spin up our <a href="/features">services</a> one by one.</li>
                <li>We use <a href="/container">containers</a>, a new virtualization technology to ensure user isolation.</li>
                <li>We are working on <a href="/fastweb">fastweb</a> platform to serve web traffic much faster.</li>
                <li>We will kick ass again.</li>
